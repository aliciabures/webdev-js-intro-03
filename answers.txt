    Explain why a number data type added to a string data type returns a string.
            This is because JavaScript will assume the data is a string and concatinate it. 

    Name a scenario where using the == operator could cause a bug.
        The operator == converts the data if it is a different type before it compares them, but this can lead to errors
   
    Name the operator(s) that you find confusing and explain why.
        I'm confused by the difference between =, ==, and ===. It's just been difficult to remember the difference and I have to look it up everytime. 
    
    Explain a situation where you would use the Modulus operator and why.
